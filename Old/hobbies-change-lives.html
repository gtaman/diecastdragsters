People who have a hobby
"are generally healthier," says Peter Lichtenberg, Ph.D., director of
the </font>Institute<font size="2"> of </font>Gerontology<font size="2">
at </font>Wayne State University<font size="2">.
"We also know they are at a lower risk for depression and dementia. The
great value of hobbies is they're a way for people to stay engaged on multiple
levels."</font><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span><br /><br />
</span><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: black;"><font size="2">Psychologist Michael Brickey, Ph.D., is the author of the book Defy Aging and
president of the Ageless Lifestyle Institute in </font>Columbus, Ohio<font size="2">.
His focus is on helping people stay physically and mentally active so they can
enjoy their later years. Dr. Brickey says hobbies help by reducing stress and
providing a sense of accomplishment.</font><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&nbsp;</span><br /><font size="2">"Hobbies can be thought of on three levels," Dr. Brickey says.
"The first is as a diversion. Hobbies help us pass the time. The second is
as a passion. When a hobby becomes a passion, we become truly engaged in doing
something we love. It not only helps us pass time, it makes us unaware that
time is passing. The third level is as something that creates a sense of
purpose. We all need that." The ideal hobby, he says, combines all three
levels.</font></span><br /><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Helvetica;

a child chooses to participate in and a hobby that is imposed by parents trying
to force children into something they don't want. If the parent and child find
an enjoyable activity they can do together, they have a much better chance of
creating a healthy environment.</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 1.5; background-color: initial;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Helvetica;

Nearly everyone would raised a hand. Then asked to keep their hands in the air if at least one of their children had a hobby, which distinguished from organized, adult-directed, after-school activities such as Little League. Most of the hands went down.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  Thirty-odd years ago, almost every kid in my neighborhood had some sort of hobby. Collecting and trading baseball cards was a popular pastime (one that's making a strong comeback today), as were coin and stamp collecting. One of my friends was into photography (he's now a photographer), another was into building radios (he's now an electrical engineer).<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  Hobbies benefit children in numerous ways. Because they are expressions of personal accomplishment and a means of self-discovery, hobbies help build self-esteem.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  Hobbies are educational tools, as well. For example, a child who becomes interested in rocketry -- one of the most popular hobbies, by the way -- learns about propulsion and aerodynamics. By working on hobbies, children learn to set goals, make decisions, and solve all sorts of problems. Finally, hobbies often mature into lifelong interests, even careers.<br /><br /><strong><u><font size="6">How to Find a Hobby for Your Child</font></u></strong><br />  If all of that sounds good, and you'd like to help your child develop and sustain a hobby interest, try these suggestions:<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <strong>Set a good example.</strong>&nbsp;Scott Harris, a hobby shop buyer and hobby workshop leader in Gastonia,  North Carolina, finds that children with hobbies tend to have parents with hobbies.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <strong>Be prepared to sacrifice space.</strong>&nbsp;Your child will need work space for his or her hobby projects. Designate a particular room, a corner of the basement, part of the garage, or similar area. Regardless of where you set up the space, your child should be able to walk away from the hobby and come back to it later. The work space should also allow for plenty of paint spills, scratches, and other hobby-related accidents -- the inevitable by-products of creative activity.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <strong>Provide some guidance.</strong>&nbsp;"Nothing will kill a child's enthusiasm for a hobby quicker than lots of frustration during the learning stage," cautions hobby expert Harris. Help your child get off to a good start by demonstrating how to closely follow a set of directions, and how to handle sometimes-delicate hobby materials with proper care.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span>  <strong>Limit television watching.</strong>&nbsp;Since 1955, when it became a fixture in America's households, television has come to dominate the spare time of the American child. By age 15, the average child has spent more time watching television than sitting in a classroom. Let's face it, it's impossible to work on a hobby and watch TV (or play video games) at the same time.<br /><br />If not for spare time, a hobby may never develop. But find a hobby, and a talent may be born, a life enriched<br /><br /><strong><u><font size="6">Hot Wheel Racing as a hobby=HWR</font></u></strong><br />HWR is often thought of as activity for people who lead quiet, relaxed lives. However, people with full, busy, even stressful lives may need this hobby more than the average person, and benefit greatly from having HWR in their lives. HWR brings many benefits that make it more than worth the time it requires. Here are some of the advantages of HWR.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span><strong><u><font size="4">  Take A Break</font></u></strong>&nbsp;HWR provides a slice of work-free and responsibility-free time in your schedule. This can be especially welcome for people who feel overwhelmed by all that they have to do, and need to recharge their batteries by doing something they enjoy. For those who feel overwhelmed by responsibility, it may be difficult to find the time or give themselves permission to take a break from a busy schedule and just sit and relax. Engaging in HWR, however, can provide a break with a purpose, which can help people feel that they&rsquo;re not just &lsquo;sitting around&rsquo;, but are using their down time for something productive. Either way, HWR provide a nice break in a busy week.<br /><span></span><br /><strong><font size="4">Eustress</font></strong>    For those who aren&rsquo;t overly stressed, and may actually be under-stimulated, HWR provides a nice source of&nbsp;<a href="http://stress.about.com/od/stressmanagementglossary/g/Eustress.htm" title="">eustress</a>&nbsp;, the healthy kind of stress that we all need to remain feeling excited about life. If the rest of your life is somewhat dull or uninspiring, HWR can provide meaning and&nbsp;<a href="http://stress.about.com/od/funandgames/a/Having-Fun-Why-It-Provides-Some-Of-The-Best-Stress-Relief.htm" title="">fun</a>&nbsp;, and can break up a boring schedule, without feeling like work. In other words, HWR can provide just the right amount of challenge.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span><strong><u><font size="4">  Social Outlet</font></u></strong>&nbsp;HWR like many other hobbies lend themselves to group activities: golfing rotations, knitting circles, and creative writing groups are good examples. Hobbies that connect you with others can bring the added benefit of&nbsp;<a href="http://stress.about.com/od/relationships/a/friendskills.htm" title="">social support</a>&nbsp;, which can bring stress relief and meaning to life in a fun way. The friends you have fun with can become some of your best friends, so hobbies that bring you closer with others are well worth your time.<br /><span></span><br /><strong><u><font size="4">Pleasure</font></u></strong>&nbsp;&mdash;activities that bring fun to life&mdash;can be wonderful for relaxation and enjoyment of the moment. Pleasures can bring a lift to your mood. Because hobbies generally incorporate pleasures into your life, maintaining hobbies can be good for your overall sense of joy in life.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span><strong><u><font size="4">  Gratifications</font></u></strong>    Also from positive psychology,&nbsp;<a href="http://stress.about.com/od/positiveattitude/a/gratifications.htm" title="">gratifications</a>&nbsp;are important activities that bring meaning and fun to life. Gratifications present the kind of challenge that requires us to use some of our best personal skills, and engage us in a sense of&nbsp;<a href="http://stress.about.com/od/stressmanagementglossary/g/flow.htm" title="">flow</a>&nbsp;, which can put us in a near-meditative state where we lose track of time and feel removed from the&nbsp;<a href="http://stress.about.com/od/stressmanagementglossary/g/stressors.htm" title="">stressors</a>&nbsp;of life, and fully engage in what we are doing. Gratifications can lead to a reduction in stress and a sense of well-being, and HWR is usually experienced as gratifications. If you want more happiness and less stress experiences in your life, HWR provide a direct route to gratifications that can lead to this.<br /><span></span><br /><strong><u><font size="4">Prevent Burnout</font></u></strong>    HWR brings a sense of fun and freedom to life that can help to minimize the&nbsp;<a href="http://stress.about.com/od/stressmanagementglossary/g/Chronicstress.htm" title="">impact of chronic stress</a>&nbsp;. Those who feel overwhelmed at a job or school, for example, can benefit from HWR because it provides an outlet for stress, and something to look forward to after a hard day (or week) at a stressful job or school. &nbsp;In other words, HWR can help buffer the effects of a stressful job or school responsibilities, and mitigate factors that contribute to burnout.<br /><span></span>&nbsp;<br /><span></span>  Health Benefits of Hobbies    One study found that those who engage in physical leisure activities for at least 20 minutes once a week are less susceptible to fatigue. Other research found that enjoyable activities performed during leisure time were associated with lower blood pressure, total&nbsp;<a href="http://stress.about.com/od/stresshealth/a/cortisol.htm" title="">cortisol</a>&nbsp;, waist circumference, and body mass index, and perceptions of better physical function. Such activities were also correlated with higher levels of positive psychosocial states and lower levels of depression and negative affect.<br /><span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span></div></div>
